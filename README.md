The goal of this proejct was to generate quick graphs for visual analysis of the data in the "Individual household electric power consumption Data Set" from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository. 

This repository contains a codebook for the dataset. It also contains R code used to generate each of the four plots with the a png extension and the plots as well. All the plots are a subset of the data. Only the dates from Febrarury 1, 2007 through February2, 2007 are utilized in making the graphs.

Plot 1 (plot1.png and plot1.R) is a histogram of the Global Active Power during these two days

Plot 2 (plot2.png and plot2.R) is a comparison of Global Active Power versus time. 

Plot 3 (plot3.png and plot3.R) shows the sub metering valeus versus time

Plot 4 (plot4.png and plot4.R) is composed of four figures: global active power versus time, voltage versus time, sub metering versus time, and global reactive powere, versus time. 

This repository also contains the Rcode "Project code.R" that can be used to generate all four plots in a single piece of code.
